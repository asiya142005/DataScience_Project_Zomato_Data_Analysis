# DataScience_Project_Zomato_Data_Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data to understand customer
preferences related to online ordering, restaurant types, and pricing.

## 🎯 Business Questions
- Do restaurants offering online delivery perform better than offline-only?
- Which restaurant types are most favored by customers?
- What price range is preferred by couples for dining out?

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- R Programming
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- reshape2
- stringr

## 📊 Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation using RMSE

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Compared online vs offline restaurant performance using countplots and boxplots
- Analyzed restaurant popularity using votes and ratings
- Studied cost preference for couples using cost distribution
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict restaurant ratings
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and actual vs predicted plots
